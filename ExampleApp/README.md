ExampleApp shows most common, basic use cases of RxBluetoothKit. It's built with Catalyst, to provide the most real life experience even for those who currently don't own any BLE sensor to connect with. You just need an iOS device and a mac computer to quickly see by yourself how to advertise services and characteristics, scan for peripherals, connect to them and observe the changes.

## Central mode

Central mode is divided into two common use cases:
* *Specific*: Quickly [connect](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/Screens/CentralSpecific/CentralSpecificViewController.swift) to a specific peripheral, with known service and characteristic UUIDs and subscribe to changes of the value. BLE connection is done in a single Rx chain to show how easy and flexible RxBluetoothKit is. This screen also presents the desired way of ending a connection (see [here](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/Screens/CentralSpecific/CentralSpecificViewController.swift#L51))
* *List*: List peripherals in range, connect to selected one, list it's services and characteristics and specifically [read](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/Screens/CharacteristicRead/CharacteristicReadViewController.swift), [subscribe to notifications](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/Screens/CharacteristicNotify/CharacteristicNotifyViewController.swift) or [write](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/blob/new-example-app/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/Screens/CharacteristicWrite/CharacteristicWriteViewController.swift) to a characteristic. To show the best way of handling BLE in larger apps, we encapsulated connection logic in a separate object, a [BluetoothProvider](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/BluetoothProvider/BluetoothProvider.swift).

## Peripheral mode

Peripheral mode gives you the overview on how to advertise specific service with a specific characteristic for [update notifications](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/Screens/PeripheralUpdate/PeripheralUpdateViewController.swift), [reading](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/Screens/PeripheralRead/PeripheralReadViewController.swift) and [writing](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit/blob/new-example-app/ExampleApp/ExampleApp/Screens/PeripheralWrite/PeripheralWriteViewController.swift) to said characteristic.

## Requirements
* Xode 12.0

## Installation

1. Open up `ExampleApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode and give some time to SPM to set up dependencies.
2. In `Signing & Capabilities` set team for iOS distribution to your "personal team".
3. Run the project on "My Mac" target
4. Without stopping the project, run again on iOS device.
5. Enjoy BLE connection between your device and your mac ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

Typical steps to see the BLE connection:

1. On iOS device, choose `Peripheral` mode, then `Update`
2. Enter service UUID (f.e. "AAA1") and Characteristic UUID (f.e. "BBB2"), then tap `Advertise`
3. On Mac, choose `Central`, then `Specific`
4. Enter the same service and characteristic UUIDs as in `2.`
5. Click `Connect`. If the connection is successfull, you should see `Read value` label turning green
6. On iOS device enter some text in the `Value` field. Tap `Update`
7. Observe updated value on your Mac ðŸŽ‰

Alternatively, you can try advertising in different modes, f.e. write:
1. On iOS device, choose `Peripheral` mode, then `Write`
2. Enter service UUID (f.e. "AAA1") and Characteristic UUID (f.e. "BBB2"), then tap `Advertise`
3. On Mac, choose `Central`, then `List`. Then click the magnifying glass toolbar icon in the upper-right-hand corner to start scanning for peripherals
4. On the list, find a peripheral named `RxBluetoothKit`. Tap it
5. On the list of peripheral's services, find a service with uuid entered in `2.`
6. On the list of the chosen service's characteristics, find the one you entered in `2.`
7. Click `Write`
8. Enter string value to be written to a characteristic. Click `Write`
9. Observe the written value on your iOS device ðŸŽ‰
